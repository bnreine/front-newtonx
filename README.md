# front-newtonx

This is a front-end list application that allows the user to dynamically create lists and add/delete items from any of the existing lists.  I've build this using React.  Originally, I tried to maintain list title state in App and list item state in the child component to App (List), but the list items did not stay associated properly with their respective list names.  Instead, I lifted most state up to the root level (App) and that solved the problem.  The basic component hierarchy looks like this: App ---> List ---> Item.  I've included a picture to outline this project's architecture here: root/project_architecture.png.  Here is the deployed site: https://bnreine-front-newtonx.herokuapp.com/
